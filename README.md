# TIV_spatial_discretisation_code
Code supporting Williams et al. paper submission




This repository contains three principal MATLAB codes which run the three variations of the model as described in the Results section of the manuscript. In particular, "RUN_FULL_MODEL.M" implements the full multiscale multicellular TIV model. Executed as-is, these codes reproduce plots used in the paper figures, sometimes in conjunction with analysis scripts in the relevant subfolders. Instructions on how these additional scripts are used, as well as modifications required to generate additional graphics are given in the descriptions for the main scripts.
